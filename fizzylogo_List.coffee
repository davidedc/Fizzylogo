class FLListClass extends FLClasses


  # A note about messages, which are special lists.
  # ...a fizzylogo message is just an FLList which is meant to
  # be used as a message only, which means that:
  #    - its elements don't change
  #    - because the underlying elements don't change, it can be
  #      copied quickly (keeping reference to old values)  
  #    - it can be split ( "." splits statements)
  #    - we can "consume" one or more elements
  #    - we don't need messages to be fizzylogo objects,
  #      they are part of the runtime and invisible to
  #      the user.
  #    - a message is never sent a message, because
  #      a message is not a fizzylogo object
  #
  # So we try to make some of these operations more efficient
  # for messages, since all operations don't modify the elements
  # we can do splits and we can consume things just by moving
  # around a start index and an end index of an unchanging
  # array of elements.
  #
  # Basically we can navigate/consume the program without
  # copying around the elements.
  #
  # The alternative would be to use no indexes and just
  # do shallow copies at any change. That would be fine for performance
  # but there is just something about the constant shallow copying
  # during interpretation that looks like it's a quadratic
  # operation, so we say no to that.

    # slots will generate more 'd', so shorter signatures will
    # tend to be last.
